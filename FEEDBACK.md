Tools:
- Typescript.
- React.
- TailwindCSS.
- Vercel.
- VSCode.

I used TailwindCSS instead of others libraries like MaterialUI, Antd, or just plain CSS, because I needed a tool that could helped me to implement styles fast and without so much weight.

I like this folder structure because it helps you separate the user interface from the logic, and it is very easy to find the files.

Personal Notes:
It's an interesting test because you have the opportunity to demonstrate your code practices, the way that you think, and your abilities in general without doing a heavy app with a lot of functionalities that just takes too much time. 

I'm glad for the opportunity and I hope that you enjoy the result.
